# API

To instanciate a cache, do the following. You can have as many instances you want.

```javascript
    var microcache = new MicroCache();
```

## .get(key)

To get a cached asset which is in the cache. Each cached element has a unique
key to identify it.

```javascript
    microcache.get('foo');
```

## .set(key, value)

To set a element value in the cache.

```javascript
    microcache.set('foo', 'bar');
```

## .contains(key)

To know if a given asset is currently in the cache.

```javascript
    microcache.contains('foo');
```

## .values()

To return all the elements currently in the cache

```javascript
    microcache.values();
```

## .getSet(key, value)

To get an element from the cache, if it isnt already present, store it then return it

```javascript
    microcache.getSet(key, value);
```

## FAQ

1. what about plain ```var microcache = {}``` ? isnt this wrapper overengineering ?
a. i was thinking so too at first. but the syntax of a .getSet() without wrapper was too ugly for my taste :)
   "var a = cache[key] = (cache[key] || value)" from @floriancargoet
